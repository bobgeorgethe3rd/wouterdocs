Glossary Terms will be formatted in ***bold and italics*** below.

### Step 1: The Pocket

__1.__ Along the top of the pocket fold the seam allowance to wrong side, press.  
__2.__ Then fold the top hem allowance to wrong side and press, making sure the seam allowance is tucked underneath. Pin in place if you need to.  
__3.__ On the right side topstich close to where the hem edge lies underneath, making sure to catch the hem as you sew.  
__4.__ Press the seam allowance of the sides and bottom to the wrong side.  
__5.__ Pin the pocket to the front using the guides.  
__6.__ ***Edgestitch*** the sides and bottom of the pocket leaving the top open. Make sure to backstitch at the start and end to secure the pocket properly.  

<Tip>

If you have trouble catching the top hem we suggest to either ***Baste*** close to the hem edge first, and use that as a guide when stitching on the right side or pin the hem edge down from the right side making sure the pins are parallel to the top edge and use them as a guide.

### Step 2: The Front

__2.__ Press under the side seams to the wrong side along the hem lines making sure the seam allowances are tucked underneath.  
__3.__ On the right side topstich close to where the folded edges lie underneath, making sure to catch the hems as you sew.
