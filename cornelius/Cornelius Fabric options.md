### Main Fabric



### Lining (Pocket) Fabric



### Interfacing

This pattern requires the waistband to interfaced. We recommend using a **hair cloth** for the interfacing, you can either use a fusible or non-fusible which ever you prefer. If you do not access to hair cloth you can use any medium to firm interfacing you deem appropriate for waistbands.     

<Note>

If your main fabric is quite light, you may need to interface your leg bands and zipper guard with a light weight interfacing.
